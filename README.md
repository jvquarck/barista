[Barista](https://barista.dynatrace.com) is the name of [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com)'s design system, that contains all ingredients to create extraordinary user experiences. Like a barista picks the best ingredients for their coffee – and we love coffee!

One major part of the Barista design system is our [components library](https://github.com/Dynatrace/barista/tree/master/components) written in Angular.

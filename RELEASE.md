# Releasing

A new version of the Angular components is released at least once at the end of
each sprint. If there are fixes and features ready earlier, a release in the
middle of a sprint is also possible.

[Breaking changes](https://barista.dynatrace.org/components/contribute/#breaking-changes)
are released with the next (future) major version.

## Versioning

The versioning of the Angular component library closely follows **SemVer**. This
means, every version number consists of three parts (x.y.z) that have a
different meaning and describe the type of change this version introduces.

- **Patch:** (x.y.**z**): A patch version only includes fixes and small patches.
- **Minor:** (x.**y**.z): A minor version includes new features that do **NOT**
  introduce a breaking change.
- **Major:** (**x**.y.z): A major version is the only version that can contain
  breaking changes. These versions are released very rarely and are announced
  weeks in advance.

## How to release

**Note: Releasing should only be done by the maintainers of the
angular-components.**

Go to the
[pull request overview page](https://github.com/Dynatrace/barista/pulls) of the
angular-components repository and merge all pull requests marked as
`[merge-ready]` into master. Only merge pull requests marked with `[major]` when
releasing a new major version. Once all branches are merged and all merge
conflicts are resolved, follow these steps:

- Check out and update your local `master` branch.
- If you wanna do a major release run `yarn breaking-changes` which will get you
  a list of breaking changes for the next major version. If you do have breaking
  changes for the release version or have deprecations:
  - Create a branch for applying the breaking changes for this release version,
    e.g. `fix/apply-breaking-changes-4.0.0`.
  - Apply the breaking changes of the major version you want to release and
    remove deprecations.
  - Commit the breaking changes in related chunks. Add a `BREAKING CHANGE` label
    (all uppercase) in the commit message!
  - Push the commits and create a pull request.
  - When merged continue with the release. (Make sure you are on the updated
    `master` branch again.)
- Start the release wizard by entering `yarn stage-release` in your command line
  tool.
- The wizard will now prompt you for the new version number. You can select
  between a `patch`, `minor` and `major` release. The wizard will also recommend
  you the new version number based on the commits between now and the last
  release.
- Based on the version you have selected, a new release-stage branch will be
  created (e.g. `release-stage/2.0.0`) and the new version will be set in the
  `package.json`.
- A changelog based on the commits will be created and attached to the
  `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Review the `CHANGELOG.md` file and ensure that the log contains only changes
  that apply to the public library release. Move commits marked with
  `BREAKING CHANGE` to an extra "Breaking changes" section on top. When done,
  proceed by confirming the prompt in your command line tool.
- The new changelog and the version bump will automatically be committed, and
  pushed to the remote repository.
- Create a new pull request from this branch against the master branch.
- Once all required tests in the pull request have successfully been run and you
  have clicked the merge button, this version will be released.
- Create a tag for the version bump commit by running `yarn create-tag`.

## After the release

After a successful release the Barista examples (code demos) build is triggered
and the updated content for the design system is built. Check the pull request
that is automatically opened in the barista-content repository and the generated
preview. When merging this pull request all updates to component demos and the
[new changelog](https://barista.dynatrace.org/components/changelog/) will be
published in [Barista](https://barista.dynatrace.org/).
